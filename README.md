# 🧠 Digital Design with Verilog – Learning Repository

Welcome to my Verilog HDL project repository!

This collection contains over 40 Verilog files created during my journey of learning **Digital Design** using **Verilog HDL**. It includes everything from basic combinational and sequential circuits to complex modules like bus interconnects and image processors.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in digital logic and hardware description
- Practice RTL-level design and modular coding in Verilog
- Simulate, test, and debug designs using industry-standard tools
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world design components for FPGA/ASIC

## 📦 What's Inside

- Combinational logic modules (adders, multiplexers, decoders, etc.)
- Sequential logic circuits (flip-flops, counters, FSMs)
- Design examples of some projects
- Functional simulation testbenches
- RTL schematics and waveform configuration files

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Verilog HDL** (IEEE 1364)
- **Xilinx Vivado** for simulation and synthesis
- **ModelSim / Icarus Verilog** for testbench validation
- `.wcfg` waveform configuration for visual debugging

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the desired module and its corresponding testbench.
3. Simulate using your preferred tool (Vivado, ModelSim, or IVerilog).
4. Modify and experiment to reinforce learning.

## 📚 Learning Approach

- Modular design
- Top-down and bottom-up coding style
- Test-driven development using structured testbenches
- Gradual complexity scaling from basic to advanced designs
